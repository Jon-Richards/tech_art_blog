    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/">I am a link.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Links and anchor elements are designated specifically for navigation.  Links
      should not mixed with buttons, which serve a different purpose from a
      semantic standpoint.

    <h4>Good</h4>
    <p>
      This is an interesting YouTube video entitled 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U" target="_blank">

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The link has a meaningful text label.</li>
      <li>The link cannot be disabled.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bad</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Open Modal</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Links are not the same as buttons, which perform UI operations, typically
      without losing context, e.g. submitting a form or opening a modal.
    </p>
    <h4>Additional Conventions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        External links should always open in a new tab.
      </li>
    </ul>
