  <div class="copy">
    <h2>Conventions</h2>
    <p>
      The styles below are based on type selectors (HTML tags) so that the
      content itself is stylesheet agnostic.
    </p>
    <div class="prism-wrapper">
      <pre>
        <code class="language-html">
          &lt;div class="copy">
            &lt;h1>Hello World!&lt;/h1>
            &lt;p>
              The h1 and this p tag will have copy styles.
            &lt;/p>
          &lt;/div>
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      Styles can also be applied in-line using the prefix "copy" followed by a
      hyphen and the name of the tag, like so:
    </p>
    <div class="prism-wrapper">
      <pre>
        <code class="language-html">
          &lt;p class="copy-p">
            This paragraph, and only this paragraph, will have copy styling.
          &lt;/p>
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h3>Intents</h3>
    <p>
      In some instances, styling beyond simple type selectors is necessary.  For
      example, a paragraph might serve as an introduction to a larger body of
      text, or an aside might serve as a warning.  It's necessary to communicate
      these intents to the user visually.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data-intent convention provides a non-aggressive API for communicating
      the intent of the markup to the application.  HTML data attributes are
      easily accessed by both CSS and JS, and don't collide with the HTML
      specification.
    </p>
    <div class="prism-wrapper">
      <pre>
        <code class="language-html">
          &lt;p class="copy-p" data-intent="intro">
            This paragraph, and only this paragraph, will have copy styling with
            special formatting for intro's.
          &lt;/p>
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <aside data-intent="warning">
      The Intents convention is not a substitute for the ARIA specification or
      semantic HTML tags and attributes.  It's designed as a way to fill in the
      gaps where a standard or more widely supported API fails to meet the
      design's needs.
