# Style Guide

Outlines a procedural approach to designing the UI.

## Core Concepts

### When to use a different layout.

The "default" layouts are "full-bleed" and "single-column".  Both layouts
place ALL of their content within the `<main>` tag, the only difference being
that "single-column" includes padding and a max-width for the page's content.

Alternative layouts should be used only when the design calls for content that
should not be included within the `<main>` tag.  E.g., a page with ads or a
table of contents.
