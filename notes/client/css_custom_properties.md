# CSS Custom Properties

Plain HTML and custom elements should share an API format for styling.

Plan HTML elements can be thought of as very granular custom elements when
not in a larger context.

The use of custom properties should be considered an implementation detail.  The
name can map to a property 1:1, but it doesn't have to.  The name of custom
properties should provide context.
