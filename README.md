## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Vagrant (optional)
- VirtualBox (optional) 
- Python 3.9.1>=,<4.0 (optional, installed by Docker)
- Node.js 14+ (optional, installed by Docker)

## Project Overview

The project can be summarized into two sections, `client` and `server`:

**The Client Side**

The client side application is primarily TypeScript and a component based
framework.

**The Server Side**

The server side is a Django project.  Django was chosen due to Python's
proliferation in the technical art domain, being used for various tools and as
a glue layer between applications.

> For a primer on getting started with Django, see Django's official on
> [creating a demo application](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/).

## Setup

1) Install the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) mentioned above.
2) Place a `.env` file in the `<project dir>/server` directory.
   > Absolute paths should be relative to the docker container's working
     directory, which is `/app`.  
   > Example: `STATIC_FILES_URL='/app/server/blog/static/'`

## Running The Project

The project uses Docker to manage its core dependencies, with
`docker-compose.yml` managing each service.

> This repo includes a Vagrant VM that runs Ubuntu and installs Docker during
provisioning.  You don't __have__ to use the VM to run te project if your
system already supports Docker.

**Building an image.**
```
$ docker-compose build
```

**Running the server**
```
$ docker-compose up
```

**Performing Node/NPM tasks**
```
$ docker-compose node <command> <options>
```

**Attaching to a running container**
```
$ docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash
```

## Using the VM

The repo comes with a Vagrant VM configured to run Ubuntu 18.04 and install
Docker during provisioning.  If your system doesn't support Docker, but can run
a VM, this is a viable alternative.

**Starting the VM**
```
$ vagrant up
```

**Accessing the VM**
```
$ vagrant ssh
```

The project directory is shared with the VM at `/vagrant`.  Any changes there
will be reflected on the host machine.

## Apps

Django's concept of an "app" is fairly open to interpretation.  In the case of
this project, an "app" represents a "concern".  As a convention, apps do not
mix concerns and contain **no** foreign keys to other apps.

There are some apps however, e.g. Pages (which contains no models) that are
allowed to reference models in other apps for the purpose of building out a
human readable page.  This is an exception, not the norm.

The project is divided into the following apps:

### Blog
The core app for this project.  Handles overall project configuration.

### Pages
- Generates the web UI.  **Pages contains no models of its own**, but calls
  models from other apps for the purpose of building out HTML templates via its
  own views.

### Posts
- Concerns all things related to blog posts.
- Implements a JSON API for retrieving post information.

## Additional Notes

- When using static typechecking with the VM, you may need to install the correct
  version of python and the project's dependencies locally.  Alternatively,
  consider SSHing into the VM and working from there.
